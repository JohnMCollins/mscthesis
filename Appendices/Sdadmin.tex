\lhead{Appendix \ref{chapter:sdadmin}. \emph{Sdadmin program}}

The \textbf{Sdadmin} program is an interactive tool created to administer \textit{Specinfo files}, as described in
Section \ref{section:specinfofmt}, mainly to facilitate optimum GUI selection of ranges.

In the range selection facility, one or more spectra can be selected and simultaneously displayed on the range display
window as illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:sdadminfig} and ranges selected and adjusted using the control dialog as
displayed in Fig. \ref{fig:sdadmindlg}. The range display is re displayed immediately to reflect the changes.
