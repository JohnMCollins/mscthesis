\lhead{Chapter \ref{chapter:proxima}. \emph{Spectra of \prox}}

Two sources of spectra for {\prox} are considered in this \paperorthesis, those from {\uves} taken between 10 and 14
March 2009 studied in \citet{fuhrmeister11} and {\harps} spectra with 260 data points between May 2004 and January 2014
from the ESO archive\footnote{Based on data obtained from the ESO Science Archive Facility from programs 072.C-0488(E),
  082.C-0718(B), 183.C-0437(A) and 191.C-0505(A).} and referenced in \citet[Table 3]{suarezmascareno15}. The latter were
supplemented with 56 additional spectra from {\harps} taken between 19 January and 30 March 2016\footnote{Based on data
  obtained from the ESO Science Archive Facility from programs 096.C-0082(A) through to 096.C-0082(F).}. The {\uves}
data were obtained with a 0.8 or 1.10'' slit, yielding a resolving power of approximately 60,000., while the resolution
of {\harps} is approximately 120,000. Also studied in Section \ref{section:uvesflares} are the X-ray data from
XMM-Newton used in the \citet{fuhrmeister11} paper\footnote{Provided by Fuhrmeister, priv. comm.} to identify any
association between strong X-ray \examrevision{emission} and possible corresponding changes to the {\ha} profile.

The bulk of the results from {\harps} in this chapter are taken using the full set of data up to 30 March 2016. However
reference is made to the original set to January 2014 (``Original Set'') as this is necessary to reproduce previous
calculations of the rotation period of \prox, in particular the 116.6 days reported by \citet[Table
3]{suarezmascareno15}, which is not reproducible from the full set to March 2016 (``Full Set''). The observation times
in the \examrevision{Original Set} are used in the modelling results in Chapter \ref{chapter:modelling} as nearly all
the work on the modelling was completed prior to 2016.

\section{{\harps} and {\uves} spectra of \prox}

As mentioned in \citet{mohanty03} and subsequent papers such as \citet{jenkins09} and \citet{barnes14}, the spectra of
late \rdwarf s from approximately M5 onward, usually show {\ha} in emission. Several of the \rdwarf s illustrated in
\citet[Fig. 6]{barnes14} additionally show a distinct ``horned'' appearance, \examrevision{due to self-absorption} at
the centre of the {\ha} peak.  {\prox} consistently shows this pattern, which is displayed in
\citet[Fig. 14]{fuhrmeister11}. The two \horn s surround a local minimum. \examrevision{Not only does the equivalent
  width of the entire {\ha} peak, vary in time, but the two \horn s also vary in relative size over time. The local
  minimum between the \horn s, however, does not appear to vary greatly over time.} This would appear to be because a more
symmetrically-distributed spectral line from the photosphere is overlaid with plage and chromospheric effects which are
asymmetric or localised to regions. These may be compared with the H, K and Ca II lines discussed in
\citet{rauscher06}. The main aim of this {\paperorthesis} is to study the variations in the line and \horn s via various
methods to see if periodicity may be reliably recovered.

\section{{\ha} line measurements}
\protect\label{section:linemeas}

In Fig. \ref{fig:harps1} are shown two example spectra from {\harps} nearly 2 years apart, clearly showing the changes
in the amplitude and shape of the {\ha} line. Fig. \ref{fig:harps1} also illustrates the regions used to
investigate periodic variability.

The spectra were first normalised by iteratively fitting a cubic polynomial to all the points in all the spectra, apart
from the {\ha} region, then excluding points outside 2 standard deviations above or below the fitted polynomial to
\examrevision{eliminate other lines, both emission and absorption. The computations discussed in this {\paperorthesis}
  are then calculated from these normalised spectra.}

  \protect\label{fig:harps2}
\end{figure}

\examrevision{Fig. \ref{fig:harps1} illustrates the regions used to calculate various measurements discussed in this
  \paperorthesis. To calculate equivalent widths of the {\ha} peak, points in the range delineated by the dark red
  solid lines are considered, running from 6561.917{\AA} to 6563.839\AA, linearly interpolating points in each spectrum
  up to the boundaries of the region to minimise integer pixel noise effects. The area of this region is then calculated
  using trapezoidal integration and the value of the equivalent width is calculated as the width (in \AA) of the
  rectangle of the same area whose height would be 2, i.e., 1 above the normalised continuum\footnote{It is accepted the
    equivalent widths are normally negative for emission lines, but in this {\paperorthesis} this calculation is used to
    return analogous positive values throughout.}.}

\examrevision{Also calculated is what is herein called the ``Peak Ratio'', defined as the ratio of the mean values of
  the two \horn s. The ratio tabulated below is the mean value of the flux at each point in ``red'' \horn,, divided by
  the mean value of the flux at each value in ``blue'' {\horn}. The regions selected for the blue and red \horn s are
  shaded in blue and red in Fig. \ref{fig:harps1} and run from 6562.072{\AA} to 6562.613{\AA} and 6563.000{\AA} to
  6563.517{\AA} respectively. These do not have to be the same widths, the ``blue'' {\horn} region having a width of
  0.541{\AA} and the ``red'' {\horn} region a width of 0.517\AA. This is because the peak ratio measurement utilises the
  mean values of the selected points, which proved not to be very sensitive to the actual number in the selected range,
  hence the regions were chosen to optimise variability in the line profiles as in the observed data the ``red'' {\horn}
  tends to be higher but narrower than the ``blue'' \horn.  For similar reasons, there is no need to interpolate points
  to the boundaries of the region for the peak ratio measurement.}

\examrevision{The number of pixels in the regions, as highlighted in Fig. \ref{fig:harps1} are either 35 or 36 for the
  {\ha} region and 11 or 12 for the red {\horn} and 14 or 15 for the blue {\horn} on {\uves}. The corresponding numbers
  on {\harps} are 98 or 99, 26 or 27 and 27 or 28 respectively. The number of pixels could vary by one due to differing
  wavelength corrections caused by the barycentric component of the radial velocities.}

In Fig. \ref{fig:harps1}, at the top, is displayed the telluric line spectrum for an air mass of 1.4, to which 2.5 has
been added for clarity of display. As demonstrated in \citet[Fig. 1]{reiners15}, the telluric effects are negligible in
this region. (The Gaussian used to simulate {\ha} in that paper is considerably broader than that observed in \prox, so
the telluric line at 6564.2{\AA} can impinge on the former but not \prox.) All the spectral lines identifiable from the
Vienna Atomic Line Database (VALD) are TiO transitions, with the exception of a MgH line at 6564.29\AA.

In \citet{suarezmascareno15}, the authors use an \textit{{\ha} index}, based in turn upon the work in
\citet{gomesdasilva11}, computed by the formula:

\begin{center}

$ H\alpha_{index} = \frac{H\alpha_{core}}{H\alpha_L + H\alpha_R} $

\end{center}

In this $ H\alpha_{core} $ is defined \examrevision{as the flux in the bandpass} of width 1.6{\AA} centred on 6562.808{\AA} and $ H\alpha_L $ and
$H \alpha_R $ are defined respectively as continuum bands of widths 10.75{\AA} and 8.75{\AA} centred on 6550.87{\AA} and
6580.31\AA. That $ H\alpha_{core} $ region is delineated by the solid green vertical lines in both Fig. \ref{fig:harps1}
and Fig. \ref{fig:harps2} and the two continuum regions as the green shaded areas in Fig. \ref{fig:harps2}.
An important difference between this and calculation of the equivalent widths and peak ratios is that the
spectra do not have to be normalised for the {\ha} Index calculation as the calculation supplies its own normalisation.

The region chosen for calculation of the {\ha} equivalent width in this {\paperorthesis} is slightly wider than that
chosen for the {\ha} index in the \citet{suarezmascareno15}. This was chosen as it appeared on-average to encompass the
whole of the {\ha} peak more accurately and \examrevision{to} better record the variations. In practice, there was
negligible difference between the calculated results for either method using the two pairs of limits. Adjusting the
continuum ranges used for calculation of the {\ha} Index to cover much wider ranges, including the entire area of that
spectral order clear of the {\ha} peak, whilst yielding different values, the proportionate ranges were very similar and
it made negligible difference (less than 0.1\%) to the periodicity calculations.

In Table \ref{table:ewtabfirst} are listed the equivalent widths, {\ha} Index and peak ratios from the {\uves} and
{\harps} data for {\prox}. Histograms of the equivalent widths are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:proxhists}. Note
that all the equivalent widths from the {\uves} data are displayed, but the seven very highest from the {\harps} data are
omitted, which have equivalent widths of over 6, which are listed in Table \ref{table:excessews}. \examrevision{These
  were omitted from Fig. \ref{fig:proxhists} as their display would have caused Fig. \ref{fig:proxhists} to be too wide
  for no particular benefit.}

Bearing in mind the study of kurtosis in {\ha} in \citet{flores16} for HD 45184, for this {\paperorthesis} other
possible calculations of periodicity were derived from skewness and kurtosis of the {\ha} peak and from residual {\ha}
lines. The residuals were created by division of each spectrum by mean of the 5 spectra with the lowest equivalent
widths. \examrevision{In Table \ref{table:divcompar} are recalculated the figures for the median residual equivalent
  widths and peak ratios for {\harps} which were previously displayed in Table \ref{table:ewtabfirst}}. The same two
spectra which are displayed in Fig. \ref{fig:harps1} are re-displayed after this treatment in
Fig. \ref{fig:harpsfirsthad5}. A histogram of the residual equivalent widths is displayed in Fig. \ref{fig:residhists}.

The spectra from {\harps} also contained a prominent absorption line in the same spectral order as the {\ha} line. This
can be seen shaded in dark green in Fig. \ref{fig:harps2}. Identifying this from VALD as
primarily a TiO transition, it seemed worth looking briefly to see if the equivalent width variations and a version of
the peak ratio calculation yielded any periodicity results, albeit as stemming from the photosphere it is not a similar
measure to the chromosphere as with \ha. However, no clear period could be identified, in particular the 82.6-day period
could not be found in the results, which for completeness are presented in Appendix \ref{chapter:tioline}. A similar
exercise was briefly carried out with the He-6678 line in the adjacent spectral order to that for {\ha} used in
conjunction with the flare identification in Section \ref{section:harpsflares} but that was only prominent to any degree
in conjunction with what appeared to be flares and it was not feasible to identify any periodicity in that line.

A future line of enquiry might be to combine an assortment of such lines in order to derive a type of a composite
spectral index as discussed in \citet{hall99} and \citet{hall00}, however initial attempts to combine these lines with
the {\ha} line proved of little value as the {\ha} peak is so much greater and the results were indistinguishable from
the {\ha} results alone.

\section{Flares in {\uves} data and X-ray values}
\protect\label{section:uvesflares}

In \citet[fig. 1 to fig. 3]{fuhrmeister11} the measured flux for various wavelengths for each of the three observation
nights are presented. In Fig. \ref{fig:uves1}, Fig. \ref{fig:uves2} and Fig. \ref{fig:uves3} are displayed the {\ha}
equivalent width and the X-ray counts for these nights together with the peak ratios. As the X-ray flux is so much
greater on the third day, the third panel is potentially misleading, so these are re-displayed all to the same scale
below in the bottom panel.

In Fig. \ref{fig:uves1} it is apparent that the peak ratios for the first day (10 March 2009) seemed to have periodic
nature for a portion of the plot, as did a much smaller portion of the plot for the third day (14 March 2009), shown in
Fig. \ref{fig:uves3}. The portion on the first day had a strong period of approximately half an hour and the third day a
much weaker period of about 20 minutes.  However there were no other periods found in the other day of a similar
strength or value, either for peak ratios or equivalent widths. However it was noted that in \citet[Section
4.1]{barnes14} there is speculation of instrumentation error on the first and third days applied to this data. By
cross-correlation using the 6565-6585{\AA} region, it is possible to shift the spectra to compensate for apparent radial
velocity variations. This enables the periodic signal to be reduced substantially in the first day's plot and almost
completely in the third day's plot. As these periods were not directly relevant to this project, focusing on the
rotation period of {\prox} which was believed to be much greater, it was decided not to investigate this particular
possible behaviour further.

The {\uves} data showed a large flare during the third of the observation periods starting at approximately 06:15 on
14th March 2009. Both the equivalent width and X-ray counts rapidly reached a peak, with the equivalent width peaking
approximately a minute before the X-ray count peaked. The equivalent width reached a similar level at the end of the
first observation period to that which it reached during the flare in the third, albeit much more slowly, but with only
very slight evidence of a corresponding increase in the X-ray count. However there was an increase in the {\uves}
optical ''blue'' flux on the first day, as shown in \citet[fig. 1]{fuhrmeister11} corresponding to the higher equivalent
widths, \examrevision{suggestive of some other process than that in the third day which did show the higher X-ray level}.

\section{Possible flares on {\harps}}
\protect\label{section:harpsflares}

There are no corresponding X-ray data available for the {\harps} data, but as the {\uves} data suggests that {\ha}
equivalent width increases with flares, the higher values of equivalent width in the {\harps} data as were selected as
indicative of flares. After some experimentation with investigation of periodicity, the effects of possible flares
seemed to be minimised if the proportion of data with the lower 90\% of equivalent widths were selected. In both {\uves}
and {\harps} this was approximately one standard deviation from the median, 2.0{\AA} in the case of {\uves} and 4.2{\AA}
in the case of {\harps}.

The {\harps} data contains seven spectra with particularly large values of equivalent width of over 6.0{\AA}, listed in
Table \ref{table:excessews}.  Following \citet[fig. 8]{fuhrmeister08} in relation to flares on CN Leonis, the He-6678
line equivalent widths were also calculated and are also included in that table. It was noticeable that only a few
spectra had any significant He-6678 \examrevision{emission}, only seven spectra had equivalent widths greater than one
standard deviation of 0.059 above the median of 0.054, which are listed in the table. If these are clipped from the
He-6678 results, the standard deviation of the He-6678 line equivalent widths sinks to 0.10. In Fig. \ref{fig:dualews1},
Fig. \ref{fig:dualews2} and Fig. \ref{fig:dualews3} the equivalent widths for {\ha} and He-6678 are plotted against each
other for each of the three years 2013, 2014 and 2016, showing the correlation only when the {\ha} line is maximal.

\caption{\examrevision{This table lists, in descending order of {\ha} equivalent width, the seven spectra mentioned in
    Section \ref{section:linemeas} and Fig. \ref{fig:proxhists} as having equivalent widths over 6.0 (and not displayed
    in that figure). As well as showing the values of the {\ha} equivalent width, that of the He-6678 line is also
    displayed. This table also shows the seven spectra having the He-6678 line with the largest equivalent width, five
    of which, not marked with * or $\dagger$, are common to the set of seven with largest \ha. The two remaining out of the seven
    with exceptional {\ha} but not an exceptional He line are marked with * and vice versa for the ones marked with $\dagger$.}}
